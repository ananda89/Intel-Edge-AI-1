# Fruits Classifier

For the project showcase for Intel Edge AI foundational course on Udacity, we used this [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/moltean/fruits) on kaggle to classify fruits and on the basis of their classification we will have their nutritional information in real time by calling an [API](https://www.edamam.com/). 

For inference, this model uses Intel OpenVINO library which will be used to deploy it at the edge.
